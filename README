# Raketex

This was my little playground during the 
creation of my diploma thesis.
Building the infrastructure around the
latex, graphviz and bibtex tools was
much more interesting than creating boring
content for my thesis.

Now then, use it for your own projects - have *fun*
and give feedback.

Regards to skade, who made the whole foundation
to this little rAke-fun.
